    "aboutme":"I am currently an Engineering Immersion student at Thinkful. I live in Orlando, FL and love to read, go to the beach and play with my dog.  Due to life circumstances combined with the COVID pandemic, I decided it was time to make a change.  I took my first coding course in 2006, became more interested in web design while working as an Administrative Assistant at RE/MAX.  In early 2020, I decided that I wanted to learn more about web development, found the Thinkful program, and was fortunately accepted and granted this wonderful opportunity to learn years of information in a fairly short time.  I'm thrilled to have this knowledge and skill set, and already have set my sights on new projects to challenge me and fine-tune my skillset.",
